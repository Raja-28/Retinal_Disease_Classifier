# 👁️ Visionary AI: Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy

An AI-powered full-stack web application that detects **diabetic retinopathy** from retina fundus images — with **real-time prediction, Grad-CAM explainability, and a modern UI**.

🎯 Built for the **Visionary AI Hackathon: Hacking Blindness Before It Begins**.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- 🧠 Uses a fine-tuned **EfficientNetB0** model to classify eye diseases into 5 stages.
- 🌐 Powered by a **FastAPI backend** for fast inference.
- 💡 Comes with a **Streamlit frontend** — upload → see result → download proof.
- 🔍 Includes **Grad-CAM heatmaps** to highlight what the AI sees.
- ✅ Returns confidence scores to support decision-making.
